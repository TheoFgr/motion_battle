      <br>
      Unfortunately one day, the awful Saruman decided to unleash his dragons to destroy its inhabitants.
      <br> 6-year-old Sam saw her parents being devoured.
      <br>
      He promised himself to avenge them.
      <br>
      Now 18, Sam no longer wants to hide, he feels strong enough to free the world from its dragons and avenge his parents ! </h2>
